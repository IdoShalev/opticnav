    <h3>Statement of the problem</h3>
    <p>
    ARIS requires a system that makes use of an optical head-mounted display. 
    It is required that the system delivers a function that is "cool" and easy 
    to demonstrate.</p>
    
    <p>The design should be flexible enough to work on different variations of 
    Augmented Reality Devices (ARD for short)</p>

    <p>Examples of such devices: Recon Jet, MOD Live, Google Glass, Nexus 5, most 
    Android phones.</p>
    
    <p>The SAIT Information Technology - Software Development program's requirements 
    for the system are:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Uses a SQL database</li>
    <li>Has a web front-end</li>
    <li>Is written in the Java Programming Language</li>
    </ul>
